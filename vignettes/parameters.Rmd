# Parameters



### Number of replicates
LipiqQuan contains a section for specifying the number of replicates in the input intensity data. If the input text is set to 1, this means that there is only the original sample extract, whereas setting the number to 2 means 2 replicates, 3 means 3 replicates etc. Also, in this field, the user can specify whether the input intensity data contains replicates in the blank extracts or not. This is done by using the checkbox marked as 'Blank contains replicates'.




### Number of instances threshold & Threshold of instance
Below the field of specifying the number of replicates, the user can also specify two parameters for filtering out unrealiable measurements. This is done by using the 'Threshold of instance' and 'Number of instances threshold' fields in LipiqQuan. In the 'Threshold of instance' the user can specify what level of intensity will be considered as 'real signal'. In the 'Number of instances threshold' the user can specify how many of the replicates in a given sample that should have a value above the 'Threshold of instance' before the sample in question will be considered to have a 'real' signal. 

'Number of instances threshold', the user can

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Introduction

install LipidQuan, the user needs to have installed R first on the computer.
For convenience, it is also recommended to install R studio. The ComplexHeatmap
package needs to be installed in R in order for LipidQuan to work. This can be
done in R studio, by typing the following in the command line:

source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")

biocLite("ComplexHeatmap")


###Install LipidQuan from Bioconductor
The easist way to install LipidQuan is to open R/RStudio and type the following
two commands in the command line:

source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")

biocLite("lipidQuan")



###Install LipidQuan from binary/source file
To install LipidQuan from source, open R/RStudio and type the following in the
command line:

install.packages("path-to-file", repos = NULL, type="source")

, where "path-to-file" is the path to the source file. For example:

install.packages("../lipidQuan_0.1_R_x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz", repos = NULL,
type="source")

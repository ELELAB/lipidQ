### Introduction
The global options operation tab in the LipiqQuan GUI makes it possile to create both databases and user specified column names templates, when the user needs to have a new version. There can be several reasons why the user wishes to do so. Here are the two most common ones:

1. If the file has been corrupted, e.g. by typing in errors in the templates, which makes them unusuable, the user can re-create a template and start over, if the source of the corruption can not be found by manual inspection.

2. If the user has more than one project with different settings, the user can create a template for each project. Remember to save the files at different locations so that the template file is not overwritten. The best practice is to have a folder for each project. 

### Reset Database templates
In order to create/reset a user specified column names template file, the user simply needs to do the following four steps:
1. Specify which database type to create (endogene database or ISTD database)
2. Import the user specified column names file for the project, so that the new database will have these column names.
3. Specify the path to where the template file should be saved
4. Press 'Create column template file'


### Reset column names template
In order to create/reset a user specified column names template file, the user simply needs to do the following three steps:
1. Specify the number of MS2 columns
2. Specify the path to where the template file should be saved
3. Press 'Create column template file'
